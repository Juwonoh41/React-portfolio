        <p>
          My current skillset lies in MERN stack development. On the server side I am both familiar with Mysql and MongoDb. 
          I am experienced with Express.js, and Node.js. My passion for coding comes from an early childhood filled with playing video games. 
          My current hobbies are Yu-gi-oh, Pokerstars Vr, and working out.
