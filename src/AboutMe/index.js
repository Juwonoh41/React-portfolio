        <p>
          I was born in South Korea, Seoul. I immigrated to the US when I was five years old. 
          I am a naturalized citizen.
          I currently live in San Diego, California. My hobbies range from hiking, to martial arts.

          I have three years worth of experience in the resturant industry. In that time I learned many vital
          skills that can be utizlied within in a broad scope. I learned how to flourish in a high stress envoirment. I also
          learned to thrive off of constructive criticism. Another vital skill I learned in the resturant industry
          is the importance of teamwork. The need to not only pull your weight but the ability to detect when 
          others require help. Currently I am learning the skills needed for front-end and back-end development.
